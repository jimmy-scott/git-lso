git-lso: list and verify loose objects
--------------------------------------

Lists and verifies all loose objects found in '.git/objects/??/..'.

I wrote this just for fun, so I didn't really bother checking whether
other tools cover the same functionality or ...

List and verify all loose objects in repo '/srv/git/foo':
	$ git-lso /srv/git/foo

List and verify all loose objects in bare repo '/srv/git/foo.git':
	$ git-lso --bare /srv/git/foo.git

Note: You can omit the repository name if your current working directory
      is the root of the repository you want to verify.

List, verify and show the compression ratio (100 * compr / uncompr):
	$ git-lso -c

Verify and show a summary instead of listing:
	$ git-lso -s

List and check with increased verbosity:
	$ git-lso -v
	$ git-lso -vv
	$ git-lso -vvv

Verify and show a verbose summary (check it out!):
	$ git-lso -s -v

List only, do not verify:
	$ git-lso -l

Show version:
	$ git-lso -V


Summary and verbose output explained
------------------------------------

This is an overview of all strange names and fields you see:

  zdata size:     size of the compressed object
  xdata size:     size of the uncompressed object
  compression     compression ratio of the compressed data
  odata type:     type of the object
  odata size:     size of the object without the header
  verify read:    file could be opened and read
  verify zlib:    file was able to decompress
  verify fmt1:    file contained a null byte (splits header)
  verify fmt2:    header contained a space (splits type and size)
  verify fmt3:    object type is a known object type
  verify fmt4:    object size is a number
  verify size:    object size from header matches the actual size
  verify sha1:    checksum of the object matches the id
  ERROR:          error message of the failed verify step

Verify status is either [OK] or [EE].
The 'ERROR' field will only be shown in case there was an error.

Summary has similar naming:

  zdata:   size of the compressed object
  xdata:   size of the uncompressed object
  odata:   size of the object without the header
  ratio:   compression ratio of the compressed data
